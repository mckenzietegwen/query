			T: Tell me a little bit about yourself.
			<br>
			<br>
			A: I'm currently 27 years old. I work a part-time job at a movie theater that I’ve been at for almost…four years, I want to say. I’ve done a lot of different things since I’ve been there that long. I do almost everything except the manager role, and some of the heavier lifting I can’t do because of a back problem I have. Other than that I live at my family’s house right now. I’m currently looking to go back to school in the fall for a social service worker course. It’s been a little while since I’ve been in school, but I’m excited and nervous to go back and start something new.
