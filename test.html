      <div>
        <p>Q1</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>What do you think of garden gnomes?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Hm. Ok, since I’m at my parent’s house, I wouldn’t really care because it’s not my garden. If it was my personal place, I’d be like no that’s not going there.</em> Unless there was a really, really good reason.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Tell me a little bit about yourself.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>I feel like since the last time I’ve been in school I’ve done a lot of thinking and reflecting on what I might want to go back to school for; the things I like doing; the things I don’t like doing…and one of the things I enjoy doing is helping people and</em> solving problems.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Both of these questions are intended to loosen a candidate up and see a glimpse into their personality. Accordingly, Anthony's answers equally reveal that he is a problem-solver that thinks both rationally and logically.

      <div>
        <p>Q2</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Say we finish the interview and you step outside the office and find a lottery ticket that ends up winning $10 million dollars. What would you do?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>I think it would be a good idea to keep my position and see what comes of it.</em> It would be a good opportunity for me to grow.</p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Why do you want this position?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>I feel like</em> this company is a good place for me to start and grow <em>and see which areas suit me best. So I’m just looking for a starting position.</em></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>This set of questions aim to determine a candidate's true motivation in applying for a role. Anthony's answers suggest that he is seeking this position for the opportunity to launch his career in this field, and grow as a young professional.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Q3</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Are you a hunter or a gatherer?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>I would say maybe both.<em> It depends on the situation. Like, you’re not going to hunt something that’s dangerous.</em></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>I feel like maybe once I start something I have a hard time putting it down. I like to complete things and get them finished.</em> These are weaknesses AND strengths kind of; I can kind of flip them around I’d say. <em>I can find strengths in my weaknesses. I’m very dedicated to a task and need to get it done once I start. I feel like I work well in groups and by myself.</em></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>These two questions are both getting to the bottom of a candidate's strengths and weaknesses. Both of Anthony's answers strategically bring to light his strength of being flexible and adaptable to new situations.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Q4</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>If you had a choice between two superpowers, being invisible or flying, which would you choose?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>I think invisibility is more practical. <em>If you think about flying, you have to be realistic in the sense that it’s colder the higher you go up. So you’d probably freeze up there and it wouldn’t be fun. But then what…you could just fly all over?</em></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>What is your leadership style?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>I personally would rather be an employee. <em>I like having instructions that I can follow. I’m not always the “I’m going to make the rules and now you guys have to follow them” because like I said, I don’t really like making mistakes, so I don’t want to be responsible for those kinds of decisions.</em></p>
