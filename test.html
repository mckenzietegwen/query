        <p>Q1</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>What do you think of garden gnomes?</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>...Hm. Ok, since I’m at my parent’s house, I wouldn’t really care because it’s not my garden. If it was my personal place, I’d be like no that’s not going there.</em> Unless there was a really, really good reason.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Tell me a little bit about yourself.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>...I feel like since the last time I’ve been in school I’ve done a lot of thinking and reflecting on what I might want to go back to school for; the things I like doing; the things I don’t like doing…and one of the things I enjoy doing is helping people and</em> solving problems.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Both of these questions are intended to loosen a candidate up and see a glimpse into their personality. Accordingly, Anthony's answers equally reveal that he is a problem-solver that thinks very rationally and logically.
