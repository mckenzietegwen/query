					<br>
					<br>
						<img src="assets/AH.png"> <img id="ND" src="assets/ND.png"><em> long pause </em><img id="ND" src="assets/ND.png"> Garden gnomes? <img src="assets/gnome.png"> Like…I don’t know. Honestly I’d say pretty <b>tacky.</b> Do you mean garden gnomes in the sense of people just having them on their lawn…?
					<br>
					<br>
						<span><img src="assets/TH.png"> Yeah!</span>
					<br>
					<br>
						<img src="assets/AH.png"> I think they’re kind of tacky but maybe they could look neat in certain….like if people change up their garden in the spring and then the summer. Different kinds of looks.
					<br>
					<br>
						<span> <img src="assets/TH.png"> So would you have a garden gnome in your garden?</span>
					<br>
					<br>
						<img src="assets/AH.png"> No not personally, unless it had some kind of reference that called out to me. Like <b>oh my god that’s totally me and I want that.</b> But I can’t really think of what that would be…
					<br>
					<br>
						<span> <img src="assets/TH.png"> Say someone in your house really wanted a garden gnome, would you be OK with having it in your own personal garden? Or would you be like <b>hey you gotta get rid of that?</b></span>
					<br>
					<br>
						<img src="assets/AH.png"> Hm. Ok, since I’m at my parent’s house, I wouldn’t really care because it’s not <b>my</b> garden. If it was my personal place, I’d be like <b>no that’s not going there.</b> <u>Unless there was a really, really good reason.</u>

							<span id="mainquestion">Q2: Say we finish the interview and you step outside the office and find a lottery ticket that ends up winning $10 million dollars. What would you do?</span>
						<br>
						<br>
							<img src="assets/AH.png"> I would first help any family I have that has debt, which isn’t <b>too</b> many, but I would help them with that. I’d try to be smart with it. I’d want to invest some money first, but I’d feel like my first objective would be to buy a condo or two.
						<br>
						<br>
							<span> <img src="assets/TH.png"> And would you still work?</span>
						<br>
						<br>
							<img src="assets/AH.png"> Yep! I feel like if I left this interview and found that lottery ticket today I would still pursue my education in the fall because <b>I can fail now</b> and still be OK. I’d still want to try something new. I wanna go out there and not just spend my money on needless <a href="https://stockx.com/supreme-clay-brick-red" target="_blank">(e.g. <img id="supreme" src="assets/supreme.png"> bricks, anyone?)</a> things.
						<br>
						<br>
							<span> <img src="assets/TH.png"> So if you got a job offer and you still found the lottery ticket, would you accept the offer?</span>
						<br>
						<br>
							<img src="assets/AH.png"> Yeah. I think it would be a good idea to keep my position and see what comes of it. It would be a good opportunity for me to grow.

					 <span>Q1: Tell me a little bit about yourself.</span>
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 I am currently 27 years old. I work a part-time job at a movie theater that I’ve been at for almost…four years, I want to say. I’ve done a lot of different things since I’ve been there that long. I do almost everything except the manager role, and some of the heavier lifting I can’t do because of a back problem I have. Other than that I live at my family’s house right now. I’m currently looking to go back to school in the fall for a social service worker course. It’s been a little while since I’ve been in school, but I’m excited and nervous to go back and start something new.
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 	<span>Why are you nervous?</span>
					 <br>
					 <br>
						Just because of how long it’s been since I’ve been out of school. And I’ve never considered myself someone that’s academically inclined. But I feel like the program I’m looking at suits my personality and my interests, so it should be maybe a little easier for me. I’m hoping.
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 <span>How does it suit your personality?</span>
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 I feel like since the last time I’ve been in school I’ve done a lot of thinking and reflecting on what I might want to go back to school for; the things I like doing; the things I don’t like doing…and one of the things I enjoy doing is helping people and solving problems. So I found that being a social service worker opens a lot of different avenues for things like that. Either helping with people’s housing, or jobs, or family problems, or drug problems. So I’m looking into a broad perspective of things to see which maybe pulls me in a direction.
